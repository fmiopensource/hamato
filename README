Hamato by Fluid Media Inc.
============================================

Hamato is a plugin that allows you add a glossary to your site.  By passing it a hash of words, it will
replace all occurences of those words on your page with a pop-up link (or whatever you like) that shows 
a definition your provide of that term.

It uses Hpricot so you'll need install that as well.

The popups are done using pure css.

Example
=======

To use Hamato, include the following in your layout:

	<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'hamato' %>
	
and, to create a link to toggle it on and off:
	
	<%= toggle_glossary_link 'toggle glossary'%>

The name of the link can be left blank and a default will be provided.

In your controller, add:

	after_filter :do_glossary

	def do_glossary
		# yields <a class=\"info\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\"><b>#{k}</b><span>#{v}</span></a> by default		
		set_glossary(response.body, glossary, 'p') 

		# or pass a block to create your own
		#{|k,v| "<a class=\"info\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\"><b>#{k}</b><span>#{v}</span></a>"}
  end
	
	def glossary
		{:children => 'these are small people', :ruby => 'is what we likes best' }
  end

In this example, all the <p> tags in the body of the response will be scanned for occurences of 'children' 
and 'ruby'.  If found, they are replaced with a hyperlinked version that displays a popup with 'these are
small people' and 'is what we like best', respectively, when hovered over.

set_glossary takes the string to be substituted (destructively), the hash to use as a glossary and the subset 
of tags to do the replacement on.  You can leave this blank to traverse all tags - only text should replaced.  
The block following the call is used to create the replacement tag.  If blank, a default block will be provided.
